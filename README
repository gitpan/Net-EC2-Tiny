NAME
    Net::EC2::Tiny - Basic EC2 client

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
      use 5.014;
      use Net::EC2::Tiny;

      my $ec2 = Net::EC2::Tiny->new(
            AWSAccessKey => $ENV{AWS_ACCESS_KEY},
            AWSSecretKey => $ENV{AWS_SECRET_KEY}',
            region       => $ENV{AWS_REGION},
            debug        => 1,
      );

      # We are essentially encoding 'raw' EC2 API calls with a v2 
      # signature and turning XML responses into Perl data structures

      my $xml = $ec2->send(
            Action       => 'DescribeRegions',
          'RegionName.1' => 'us-east-1',
      );

      # prints ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      say $xml->{regionInfo}->{item}->[0]->{regionEndpoint};

OVERVIEW
    This module is intended to be a quick-n-dirty glue layer between a
    script and some Amazon EC2 API calls
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/OperationList-que
    ry.html>. Normally I'd use something like bash and curl for this, but
    Amazon's API signature requirements demand a little bit more than bash
    and curl doesn't support Amazon's signature schema.

    All errors are fatal and reported via croak.

    If you want to do "serious" development with the EC2 API, you probably
    ought to use something like Net::Amazon::EC2 or VM::EC2.

ATTRIBUTES
  AWSAccessKey
    This is the Amazon API access code. Required at object construction
    time.

  AWSSecretKey
    This is the Amazon API secret key. Required at object construction time.

  debug
    Set this to a true value if you want debugging information. Defaults to
    false.

  version
    This is the AWS EC2 API version. Defaults to 2012-07-20.

  region
    This is the EC2 region to which to make calls. Defaults to 'us-east-1'

  base_url
    This is the base URL used by the module to send encoded requests to.
    Defaults to "https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com" This attribute uses
    the region attribute automatically.

  ua
    The user agent object which sends requests. Defaults to HTTP::Tiny

METHODS
  send
    This method expects key/value pair list with a required 'Action' key set
    to a valid EC2 API call. Subsequent parameters in the list must be
    appropriate parameters for the specified Action.

    The request will be signed with a valid v2 signature and submitted to
    AWS. The XML response will be turned into a Perl data structure using
    XML::Simple and returned.

SUPPORT
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-net-ec2-tiny at
    rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Net-EC2-Tiny>. I will be
    notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your
    bug as I make changes.

    Or, if you wish, you may report bugs/features on Github's Issue Tracker.

SEE ALSO
    This library is pretty useless without the EC2 API docs.
